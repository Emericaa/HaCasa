# What is HaCasa?

HaCasa is a modern yet simple dashboard design for HomeAssistant, created by [Damian Eickhoff](https://github.com/damianeickhoff) and [Fredrik Persson](https://github.com/fredrikpersson92), who also created [MiniHass MKII](https://github.com/fredrikpersson92/minihass).

We tend to make our cards and the design as simple as possible, so everyone can understand the designs and make them their own.

**HaCasa is still highly in development but feel free to creates issues, questions or ideas and don't forget to check out our [documentation](https://damianeickhoff.github.io/HaCasa) to see how you can implement our cards.**
