# What is HaCasa?

HaCasa is a modern yet simple dashboard design for HomeAssistant, created by [Damian Eickhoff](https://github.com/damianeickhoff) and [Fredrik Persson](https://github.com/fredrikpersson92), who also created [MiniHass MKII](https://github.com/fredrikpersson92/minihass).

We strive to make our cards and the design as simple as possible, so everyone can understand the designs and make them their own.

**HaCasa is still highly in development but feel free to creates issues, questions or ideas on our [Github](https://github.com/damianeickhoff/HaCasa).**

## What do you get?

HaCasa is a collection of self-designed custom cards and a matching theme. With that you can create a really nice, clean but also a simple dashboard. Most of the cards are pretty simple made, but that makes it also really easy to understand them. That comes in handy when you want to edit the card to your liking.

If you created a card you want to share with the rest of the world, feel free to send me the code and I will add it to this documentation and the overall configuration.
