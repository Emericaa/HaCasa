:::info Advanced
This card is not fully developed and has a more advanced configuration for determining the color based on the state. Any questions or issues can be asked in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7yt64Tf) or at [Github](https://discord.gg/7yt64Tf).
:::
The `hc_navigation_card` can be used to navigate to certain pages in your dashboard. Although, because HaCasa is so versitile, you can also use this card as a action card without navigation or give it another hold action.

This card is also used for the security card. Use the tabs beneath to switch between the 2 different uses.
