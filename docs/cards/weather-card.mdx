title: Weather Card
---

The weather card shows you the current outside temperature with a matching image depending on the weather state. Those images are all animated and are included in this theme. They are made by [Bas Milius](https://bas.dev/work/meteocons).

The card also shows the rain anticipation but later on it will be customizable.
